Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) have been sold off aggressively, slipping around 25%, 30%, and 40%, respectively.  Many investors fear that President Donald Trump's tariff plan will harm companies that source their goods outside the U.S. To offset the tariffs, the price of goods will rise, which means the consumer won't be able to purchase as much, harming pretty much every company.",
