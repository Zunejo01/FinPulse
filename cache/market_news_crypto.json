      "headline": "Institutions break up with Ethereum but keep ETH on the hook",
      "summary": "Ethereum is entering one of its most precarious periods since its inception. Usage on the base layer is plummeting, core metrics are nearing multi-year lows, and even co-founder Vitalik Buterin is proposing a radical architectural overhaul.\u00a0Institutions aren\u2019t waiting to see how it plays out. Blockchain data shows that long-time supporters such as Galaxy Digital and Paradigm have been slashing their Ether (ETH) holdings in recent weeks.\u00a0So far in April, Ethereum\u2019s base-layer activity has continued to collapse. Ethereum\u2019s network fees are dropping, and inflation has been rising. Though layer-2 networks continue to develop, they\u2019re cannibalizing the base layer\u2019s value capture.But the story isn\u2019t entirely about Ethereum\u2019s collapse. Some whales are treating this downturn as a rare buying opportunity. Even those who are selling Ether can\u2019t fully let it go.Ethereum gets dumped by institutions, but for how long?Institutions are dumping Ethereum, but it\u2019s the ex they keep checking on. It\u2019s not entirely out of the picture \u2014 just benched while they explore options like Solana (SOL).In recent weeks, blockchain analysts on the lookout for large crypto movements spotted several institutions moving ETH out of their tagged wallets, likely to sell. Lookonchain reported that Galaxy Digital deposited 65,600 ETH ($105.5 million) to Binance. The investment firm\u2019s Ether exposure rose to as high as around 98,000 coins in February, but that has dropped to almost 68,000 ETH at the time of writing, Arkham data shows.Galaxy dumps Ether, but not all of it. Source: ArkhamGalaxy\u2019s holdings may have declined in recent weeks, but they\u2019re still higher compared to the start of the year. Its Ether holdings reflect a broader trend seen in Ethereum-based investment products. According to CoinShares, ETH funds saw $26.7 million in outflows over the past week, bringing total outflows to $772 million over eight weeks. However, year-to-date flows remain positive, with $215 million in net inflows.\u00a0As Galaxy trimmed its Ether holdings, it also withdrew 752,240 SOL ($98.37 million), Lookonchain reported. Ethereum lost considerable momentum to Solana, which became the chain of choice during the memecoin casino frenzy that dominated much of 2024 and early 2025. While that eventually cooled amid rampant scams, bots and low-quality tokens, it also served as a technical showcase for Solana \u2014 proving its ability to process massive transaction volumes without major fee spikes or outages.Related: Pump.fun\u2019s memecoin freak show may result in criminal charges: ExpertParadigm is another investor that has cut back on Ether. On April 21, it moved 5,500 ETH ($8.66 million) to Anchorage Digital. Paradigm transferred around 97,000 ETH (around $301.57 million) to Anchorage from January 2024, which was then moved to centralized exchanges, as onchain analyst EmberCN pointed out.Paradigm Capital held about 236,000 ETH in 2019 but holds 2,873 ETH on April 23. Source: Arkham\u201cWhile institutional investors initially bought into the \u2018ultra-sound money\u2019 narrative, they\u2019re now facing a reality where decreasing protocol revenue and weakening tokenomics create legitimate concerns,\u201d Jayendra Jog, co-founder of Sei Labs, told Cointelegraph.Ethereum returns to net inflationary stateEther deflation has been an attractive selling point to Ethereum investors. It was integrated into the network through two major upgrades. First, the London hard fork of August 2021 introduced Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, which partially burns transaction fees. Then in the Merge upgrade of September 2022, Ethereum became a proof-of-stake network and drastically cut new token issuance.Ether\u2019s supply consistently decreased following the Merge until April 2024, when Ether\u2019s inflation began to accelerate. By early February 2025, the total ETH supply had surpassed its Merge level.Ether\u2019s total supply is approximately 186,705 ETH higher than it was at the time of the Merge. Source: Ultra Sound MoneyPart of Ether\u2019s inflation has been due to dropping fees, which results in less Ether burned. According to data from IntoTheBlock, Ethereum collected 1,873.52 ETH in fees from April 14 to April 21. That\u2019s slightly higher than the 1,697.61 ETH in fees from the week starting on March 17, which was the lowest amount of fees collected (measured in ETH) since July 31, 2017.Ethereum base layer\u2019s fees drop to 2017 levels. Source: IntoTheBlockButerin\u2019s radical RISC-V proposal for EthereumOn April 20, Buterin proposed the RISC-V instruction set to substitute the current Ethereum Virtual Machine contract language, aiming to improve the speed and efficiency of the network\u2019s execution layer. Some view the proposal as a white flag on the existing architecture.Source: Rooter\u201cVitalik\u2019s RISC-V proposal is essentially an acknowledgment that the EVM\u2019s fundamental architecture has reached its limits. When Ethereum\u2019s founder proposes replacing the core VM that underpins the entire ecosystem, it signals not evolution but recognition of a design limitation that can\u2019t be incrementally improved,\u201d Jog said.Cointelegraph has reached out to the Ethereum Foundation and will update this article when it answers.Related: A guide to crypto trading bots: Analyzing strategies and performanceThe proposal follows a leadership shuffling in the Ethereum Foundation following rising complaints on the project\u2019s direction.\u00a0Could Ethereum be the one that got away?Part of Ethereum\u2019s struggles has been attributed to its rollup-centric approach to scaling its network. The idea was to build layer-2 scaling networks that would offload the transactions from the base chain but still utilize its security. That has alleviated congestion issues during times of high network demand but has also created new problems of its own, such as dropping Ether burns and fragmentation of the Ethereum ecosystem.But there is an increased focus on layer-1 scaling, according to Tomasz Sta\u0144czak, the new co-executive director of the Ethereum Foundation. Sta\u0144czak said on X that the Ethereum Foundation will shift its focus to near-term goals, such as layer-1 scaling and layer-2 scaling support.Source: Tomasz Sta\u0144czakSome whales have taken advantage of Ethereum\u2019s cheaper price tag. On April 23, Lookonchain identified two wallets accumulating millions of dollars worth of ETH. The blockchain monitor identified another wallet on April 22 that has accumulated over $100 million in ETH since Feb. 15. Ether is currently down from the plus-$4,000 it reached in December but rose over 10% on April 23 to over $1,800.\u00a0In a recent client letter, Standard Chartered Bank slashed its 2025 price estimate for Ether from $10,000. However, for whales accumulating at current levels, upside potential remains, as the bank still predicts a year-end target of $4,000.Geoff Kendrick, the bank\u2019s head of digital assets research, attributed the more cautious outlook to Ethereum\u2019s structural decline, noting that the layer-2 networks designed to improve scalability are now extracting much of the fee revenue once captured by the base layer.Magazine: What are native rollups?

      "headline": "What are XRP futures and how to invest in them?",
      "summary": "If you\u2019re following developments in the cryptocurrency market, you\u2019ve likely noticed that Coinbase Derivatives has introduced XRP futures contracts to its US derivatives exchange. This move is part of a broader trend where regulated platforms are expanding access to futures trading, giving investors new ways to engage with digital assets like XRP (XRP).But what exactly are XRP futures? And how do you get involved as an investor or trader?Let\u2019s take a closer look.What are XRP futures?XRP futures are standardized financial contracts that allow you to agree to buy or sell XRP at a predetermined price on a specific future date. Rather than trading the actual token, you\u2019re trading a contract that tracks the price of XRP.These contracts are overseen by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), meaning they operate within a regulated framework. That adds a level of oversight and structure that appeals to many investors, particularly those wary of the risks tied to unregulated platforms.On April 3, 2025, Coinbase Derivatives announced it had filed with the CFTC to self-certify XRP futures contracts, and the contracts were launched on April 21, 2025.Types of XRP futures contracts offered by CoinbaseCoinbase\u2019s offering includes:Nano XRP futures represent 500 XRP per contract, cash-settled in US dollars. These are designed for retail traders and smaller institutions, offering lower capital requirements while still providing exposure to XRP price movements.Standard XRP futures cover 10,000 XRP per contract, are also settled in USD, and are aimed at larger institutions and active traders.This variety lets you choose a position size that matches your risk tolerance and investment strategy.\u00a0But what do terms like \u201ccash-settled\u201d actually mean?Both Nano and Standard XRP futures are contracts that let you trade based on the price of XRP \u2014 but you don\u2019t actually own or receive XRP. You\u2019re trading contracts that track XRP\u2019s price.And, when the contract closes, the difference between your entry and exit price is calculated (profit or loss) and settled in USD \u2014 this is what cash settlement means.\u00a0Did you know? Other products offered by the Coinbase Derivatives exchange include more than 20 futures contracts on assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Chainlink (LINK) and Stellar (XLM).Why choose XRP futures contracts over buying XRP?You might be wondering why someone would choose futures over simply buying XRP on the spot market.Here are a few reasons:Leverage: Futures often allow you to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. While this can amplify gains, it also increases potential losses.Hedging: If you already hold XRP and expect short-term volatility, futures can be used to protect your portfolio.Speculation: Futures allow you to take both long (bullish) and short (bearish) positions, so you can potentially benefit from market moves in either direction.No wallet or storage needs: Buying XRP requires a secure wallet and managing private keys, which carries risks like hacking or loss. Futures contracts are financial instruments traded on exchanges, eliminating the need for direct XRP custody.Liquidity and accessibility: Futures markets often have high liquidity, making it easier to enter and exit positions. Some exchanges offer XRP futures with lower barriers than buying XRP on certain crypto platforms, especially in regions with regulatory restrictions.Cash settlement: Many XRP futures are cash-settled, meaning you settle profits or losses in fiat or stablecoins without handling XRP itself, simplifying the process for traders avoiding crypto custody.When to choose futures contracts:You want to trade XRP price movements with leverage or flexibility to go long or short.You prefer not to deal with crypto wallets or custody.You\u2019re hedging an existing XRP position or portfolio.You\u2019re comfortable with the risks and complexities of derivatives.When to buy XRP:You believe in XRP\u2019s long-term value and want to hold it as an investment.You plan to use XRP for transactions or in its ecosystem (e.g., Ripple\u2019s payment network).You want to avoid the risks of leverage and futures margin calls.Ultimately, futures suit active traders or those seeking leveraged exposure, while buying XRP could be ideal for long-term holders or users of the asset. You must always assess your risk tolerance and goals before deciding whether to invest in XRP or XRP futures.Did you know? The MarketVector\u2122 Coinbase XRP Benchmark Rate provides a robust USD price reference exclusively for XRP traded on the Coinbase Exchange. It includes no other assets and no other exchanges \u2014 just XRP, just Coinbase.Where to invest in XRP futuresIf you\u2019re looking to invest in XRP futures, there are several platforms (other than Coinbase) offering access depending on your location and trading needs.Kraken Futures: Kraken provides XRP futures with leverage. In Australia, access is limited to wholesale clients through Beaufort Fiduciaries Pty Ltd (AFSL no. 545124). In the United Kingdom, only clients classified as Professional Clients under Financial Conduct Authority rules can trade through Crypto Facilities Limited (FRN: 757895).Binance: Binance offers XRP/USDT perpetual futures contracts, allowing users to trade XRP without an expiry date. These contracts support leverage, giving traders flexibility in managing exposure. However, as of May 28, 2024, Binance no longer supports XRP as a margin asset under its \u201cMulti-Assets Mode,\u201d though XRP futures remain available in other trading modes.OKX: OKX also provides XRP/USDT perpetual swaps, which let traders speculate on XRP price movements continuously. While OKX delisted XRP expiry futures contracts in December 2024, perpetual swaps are still supported. Traders can apply leverage and adjust positions based on their risk strategy.Bitget: It is a globally accessible platform that offers XRP futures with options to take long or short positions. It features a user-friendly interface, making it suitable for both new and experienced traders, though availability depends on regional regulations.KuCoin Futures: KuCoin supports XRP perpetual contracts (XRP/USDT) with leverage. The platform is known for low trading fees and offers various features for different trading strategies. It\u2019s accessible in many countries, with some regional restrictions.MEXC: It provides XRP futures in both USDt-margined and coin-margined formats. MEXC supports high leverage and offers educational tools, catering to traders of all levels. The platform is available in most regions, though users should check for local compliance.Delta Exchange: It lists XRP perpetual futures with leverage up to 100x. It\u2019s known for low fees and advanced risk management tools. The platform is available to traders in several countries, depending on local laws.Bitfinex: Lastly, Bitfinex offers XRP futures as part of its broader derivatives portfolio. Its platform caters to advanced users with customizable strategies. Access is region-dependent, and traders must ensure eligibility based on their location.Did you know? Coinbase crypto derivatives are not available to retail clients based in the United Kingdom or Spain due to local regulatory restrictions.\u00a0How to invest in XRP futures\u00a0If you\u2019re interested in trading XRP futures, here are general steps to get started:Choose a platform: Select a regulated exchange offering XRP futures, such as Coinbase\u2019s US Derivatives Exchange. Create an account and complete identity verification, which typically involves submitting a valid ID and proof of address.Understand the product: Research how XRP futures contracts work, including contract sizes (e.g., Coinbase offers standard contracts of 10,000 XRP or nano contracts of 500 XRP), margin requirements, leverage options and fees. Futures are complex, so review the exchange\u2019s documentation and understand risks, such as liquidation.Fund your account: Deposit USD or another accepted currency to use as collateral (margin) for trading. Check the platform\u2019s minimum deposit and margin requirements. For example, Coinbase settles futures in USD, and you can fund via bank transfer or debit card.Place your trade: Use the platform\u2019s trading interface (e.g., Coinbase Advanced) to select XRP futures contracts (symbol: XRL for standard XRP contracts on Coinbase). Decide whether to go long (buy) or short (sell), set your position size, and apply any leverage if available. Confirm the trade after reviewing details.Practice risk management: Futures carry high risks due to leverage and volatility. Set stop-loss orders, limit position sizes based on your risk tolerance, and avoid risking more than you can afford to lose. For instance, some exchanges pause trading if the underlying asset\u2019s price moves over 10% in an hour to mitigate volatility risks.Monitor the market: Track XRP\u2019s price, market sentiment, funding rates and external factors like regulatory news or macroeconomic trends. Use tools like candlestick charts or technical indicators on the platform to inform your strategy. Stay updated to adjust positions and avoid unexpected losses.Oregon targets Coinbase over XRP, cites securities violationsOregon\u2019s Attorney General has sued Coinbase, claiming the exchange offered unregistered securities, including XRP. The lawsuit argues that a wide range of digital assets traded on the platform qualify as investment contracts under state law.State officials say the case is part of a broader effort to step in where federal enforcement has pulled back. Legal experts note that while the outcome won\u2019t set a national precedent, it could influence how regulators and courts approach similar cases.The timing is notable \u2014 just weeks after the SEC dropped its case against Ripple and days after Coinbase listed XRP futures on its US derivatives exchange.Did you know? On March 25, 2025, Ripple Labs settled its long-standing legal dispute with the SEC. As part of the agreement, Ripple consented to pay a reduced fine of $50 million \u2014 down from the original $125 million \u2014 without admitting any wrongdoing.How risky are crypto futures?Futures trading offers opportunities, but it comes with significant risks \u2014 especially if you\u2019re new to derivatives. Here\u2019s what you should keep in mind:Leverage risk: While leverage can increase your returns, it also amplifies losses. A small price move in the wrong direction can quickly deplete your account.Volatility: XRP is known for its sharp price swings. Futures contracts can exaggerate the impact of volatility on your position.Funding rates: Perpetual futures contracts charge periodic funding fees, which can eat into profits if held long-term.Liquidation: If the market moves against you and your margin falls below the required level, your position may be automatically closed \u2014 often at a loss.Complexity: Futures are more complicated than spot trading. Understanding contract terms, funding rates and expiry dates is crucial to managing your trades effectively.Market liquidity: While XRP is a liquid asset, futures trading depends on active participation. Thin order books can lead to slippage and unexpected price movements.Emotional pressure: The fast-paced nature of futures trading can lead to impulsive decisions. Discipline and a clear strategy are essential.If you\u2019re new to this type of trading, consider starting with a demo account or using nano contracts to reduce your exposure while you learn.

      "headline": "Blockchain prediction markets offer new hope for scientific validation",
      "summary": "Opinion by: Sasha Shilina, PhD, founder of Episteme and researcher at Paradigm Research InstituteDecentralized prediction markets are gaining ground in the scientific world, offering an intriguing answer to the field\u2019s ongoing reproducibility crisis. While a notable share of research findings fail to replicate in independent tests, supporters believe market-driven forecasting can speed up identifying robust studies. Detractors remain cautious, worried that introducing financial wagers could compromise the measured, peer-reviewed process that has guided academic inquiry for centuries. The debate hinges on whether blockchain-based forecasting will elevate or destabilize scientific credibility.Crowdsourcing predictionsDespite these concerns, recent developments point toward real promise. Platforms like Polymarket and Pump.science have shown that crowdsourcing predictions can help refine collective judgment in fields as varied as politics and longevity. This model is being adapted for science, where it could quickly flag dubious claims and reward reproducible ones.\u00a0Although critics highlight potential market manipulation, decentralized science (DeSci) advocates argue that broad participation from multiple stakeholders could democratize the validation process, discouraging one-sided interventions by well-funded groups.The crux of the pro-market argument is the possibility of financial accountability for flawed or exaggerated studies. Under the conventional system, questionable research can remain influential for years before its shortcomings come to light. Market-based validation turns that dynamic on its head, issuing direct financial losses to those who bet on shaky findings. Of course, the same mechanism allows for the \u201cshorting\u201d of credible but lesser-known work. Supporters note, however, that transparent market structures and robust liquidity can mitigate the worst effects of speculation, putting a welcome dose of rigor back into funding decisions and public trust.Regulations and complexitiesRegulatory scrutiny adds a layer of complexity. Some jurisdictions still classify prediction markets as gambling or derivatives, limiting their growth without specialized approvals. The early experience of platforms like Augur underscores how legal uncertainties can dampen mainstream engagement. Recent shifts in digital asset regulation and greater public interest in scientific accountability suggest that, with the proper framework, a path toward legitimacy is possible. Proponents see this as an opportunity for policymakers to differentiate between purely speculative markets and those with clear societal benefits, such as improving research standards.Knowledge frameworksData integrity is another obstacle that innovators are tackling head-on. Oracles, which feed external results into blockchains, remain a weak link if they rely on unverified or manipulated sources. More advanced AI oracle networks are incorporating multiple data feeds and transparent auditing processes to overcome this. This, in turn, incentivizes labs and journals to adopt higher data reporting standards, knowing that the market\u2019s collective intelligence would quickly expose fraudulent or incomplete information.Recent: Bitcoin price prediction markets bet BTC won't go higher than $138K in 2025Some experts remain unconvinced that prediction markets alone can outperform traditional peer review. After all, scientific publication is based on specialized expertise, and markets often rely on overlapping pools of experts who may carry existing biases. Yet others counter that the financial incentive can serve as a powerful accelerant for truth, ensuring that the possibility of monetary loss balances any conflict of interest. Rather than replacing peer review, prediction markets could operate in parallel, catching oversight or misconduct that slips through editorial filters.For advocates, this blend of market-driven oversight and decentralized participation holds the greatest promise. With a growing number of platforms willing to host questions on scientific claims and major institutions increasingly alarmed by irreproducible research, the stage is set for a new era of rigorous public validation. The outcome remains uncertain, but the core idea \u2014 that a small bet can spark a significant reckoning \u2014 has won over many open-science supporters and decentralized finance innovators. If blockchain-based prediction markets continue to mature, they may become a key ally in restoring scientific credibility, offering a faster, more transparent form of discovery.Opinion by: Sasha Shilina, PhD, founder of Episteme and researcher at Paradigm Research Institute.

      "headline": "Here\u2019s how HEX\u2019s Richard Heart beat SEC fraud charges",
      "summary": "Richard Heart, the controversial founder of HEX, is claiming total victory over the US SEC after years of court battles.On April 21, the SEC said that it would not amend and refile its fraud case against the former child actor and crypto evangelist. A court had dismissed the SEC\u2019s fraud charges against Heart on Feb. 28.Heart announced on X that HEX had obtained a victory very few crypto projects could boast: \u201cRichard Heart, PulseChain, PulseX, and HEX have defeated the SEC completely and have achieved regulatory clarity that nearly no other coins have.\u201dHEX may be out of hot water with American securities regulators (for now), but Heart still faces charges in Europe, where he is wanted both for alleged tax fraud and for alleged assault on a minor.\u00a0Richard Heart, real name Richard James Schueler, is still on Interpol\u2019s wanted list. Source: InterpolSEC claimed Heart used HEX to defraud investorsIn July 2023, the SEC filed a complaint against Heart, whose real name is Richard James Schueler, along with HEX, HEX\u2019s layer-1 blockchain project, PulseChain, and the decentralized exchange (DEX) for the PulseChain network, PulseX.\u00a0The SEC made a number of allegations, including securities fraud and securities registration violations. It asked the court to bar Heart and his projects from participating in any sort of crypto asset security offering and to give up \u201call ill-gotten gains received as a result of the violations alleged.\u201dThe complaint noted Heart\u2019s repeated claims that HEX could offer incredible rewards to make investors rich. It also wrote that Heart spent over $12 million of proceeds from HEX offerings on luxury goods such as watches, sports cars and a 555-carat diamond ring.Indeed, Heart is no stranger to the finer things in life. His celebrity is in part due to his frequent displays of wealth. In one video on X, he flaunted Louis Vuitton cases filled with dozens of luxury watches that he said were worth 9 million euros.\u00a0Richard Heart wears four Rolex watches. Source: Luxury BazaarHeart\u2019s court case came down to jurisdiction. Last year, his legal team filed a motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that the SEC failed to show that any activities had occurred within the United States.\u00a0The SEC protested the motion. Ultimately, US District Judge Carol Bagley Amon agreed with Heart (the HEX founder does not live in the US), and she ruled that the statements regarding HEX\u2019s price were targeted to a global audience \u2014 not US investors.\u201cThe alleged misappropriation occurred through digital wallets and crypto asset platforms, none of which were alleged to have any connection with the United States,\u201d Amon stated.Finnish authorities want Heart on tax and assault chargesHeart claims that this legal victory provides new ground on which the crypto industry can thrive, creating a legal precedent that supposedly makes HEX safer to work with than any other crypto project.Heart and HEX may not face American securities regulators, but he is still in hot water with Finnish authorities over alleged tax evasion and assault.In September 2024, Finnish media wrote that Heart, who was reportedly residing in Helsinki, was remanded into custody in absentia. Finnish investigators, at the request of the country\u2019s tax authorities, were investigating Heart and reportedly found that Heart\u2019s income reporting did not match the tax service\u2019s estimates.Helsinki police detective Harri Saaristol said, \u201cBased on the very considerable amount of money in question and the long-term and planned nature of the activity, there are grounds to suspect gross tax evasion.\u201dRelated: Interpol issues \u2018Red Notice\u2019 for Hex founder Richard HeartIn the course of their investigation, Finnish police seized millions of euros worth of luxury watches from a residence in the city of Espoo near Helsinki.\u00a0Europol also stated that Heart (referred to as Schueler in the report) is wanted for assaulting a minor. \u201cSchueler physically assaulted a 16-year-old victim by grabbing their hair, dragging them into the stairwell and knocking them to the ground.\u201dThe allegations together have earned him a profile on Europol and Interpol\u2019s most wanted criminal lists. Investigations are ongoing.\u00a0How long can HEX keep it up?It seems Heart dodged US regulation because the SEC lacked jurisdiction rather than evidence. So, how long can he keep HEX going?Industry observers and analysts have long claimed that HEX was a new form of Ponzi scheme, namely due to the promises of a whopping 38% annual percentage yield, larger profits for onboarding new users and the fact that Heart owned some 90% of HEX tokens.Despite a number of committed acolytes on social media, the token seems all but dead. HEX\u2019s price pumped briefly on news of the SEC dismissal. Zooming out, it\u2019s barely moved since Heart\u2019s legal troubles with the SEC began.At publishing time, HEX\u2019s price is $0.002253; 24-hour transaction volumes barely top $250,000.\u00a0HEX\u2019s price spiked in 2021 before nearly falling off by early 2023.

      "summary": "Crypto drainers, malware designed to steal cryptocurrency, have become easier to access as the ecosystem evolves into a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model.In an April 22 report, crypto forensics and compliance firm AMLBot revealed that many drainer operations have transitioned to a SaaS model known as drainer-as-a-service (DaaS). The report revealed that malware spreaders can rent a drainer for as little as 100 to 300 USDt (USDT).Crypto drainers report image. Source: AMLBotAMLBot CEO Slava Demchuk told Cointelegraph that \u201cpreviously, entering the world of cryptocurrency scams required a fair amount of technical knowledge.\u201d That is no longer the case. Under the DaaS model, \u201cgetting started isn\u2019t significantly more difficult than with other types of cybercrime.\u201dDemchuk explained that would-be drainer users join online communities to learn from experienced scammers who provide guides and tutorials. This is how many criminals involved with traditional phishing campaigns transition to the crypto drainer space.Related: North Korean hackers target crypto devs with fake recruitment testsCybercrime in Russia \u2014 almost legalGroups offering crypto drainers as a service are increasingly bold and some are evolving almost like traditional business models, Demchuk said, adding:\u201cInterestingly, some drainer groups have become so bold and professionalized that they even set up booths at industry conferences \u2014 CryptoGrab being one such example.\u201cWhen asked how a criminal operation can send representatives to information technology industry events without repercussions, such as arrests, he pointed to Russian cybercrime enforcement as the reason. \u201cThis can all be done in jurisdictions like Russia, where hacking is now essentially legalized if you're not operating across the post-Soviet space,\u201d he said.The practice has been an open secret in the cybersecurity industry for many years. Cybersecurity news publication KrebsOnSecurity reported in 2021 that \u201cvirtually all ransomware strains\u201d deactivate without causing harm if they detect Russian virtual keyboards installed.Similarly, the information stealer Typhon Reborn v2 checks the user\u2019s IP geolocation against a list of post-Soviet countries. According to networking firm Cisco, if it determines that it is located in one of those countries, it deactivates. The reason is simple: Russian authorities have shown that they will act if local hackers hit citizens of the post-Soviet bloc.Related: What is Bitcoinlib, and how did hackers target it?Drainers keep growingDemchuk further explained that DaaS organizations usually find their clientele within existing phishing communities. This includes gray and black hat forums on both clearnet (regular internet) and darknet (deep web), as well as Telegram groups and channels and gray market platforms.In 2024, Scam Sniffer reported that drainers were responsible for about $494 million in losses, a 67% increase over the previous year, despite a 3.7% increase in the number of victims. Drainers are on the increase, with cybersecurity giant Kaspersky reporting that the number of online resources dedicated to them on darknet forums rose from 55 in 2022 to 129 in 2024.Developers are often recruited through normal job adverts. AMLBot\u2019s open-source intelligence investigator, who prefers to remain anonymous for safety reasons, told Cointelegraph that while researching drainers, his team \u201cdid come across several job postings specifically targeting developers to build drainers for Web3 ecosystems.\u201dHe provided one job advert that described the required features of a script that would empty Hedera (HBAR) wallets. Once again, the offer was mainly targeted at Russian speakers:\u201cThis request was originally written in Russian and shared in a developer-focused Telegram chat. It\u2019s a clear example of how technical talent is actively recruited in niche, often semi-open communities.\u201cThe investigator further added that ads like this appear in Telegram chats for smart-contract developers. Those chats are not private or restricted, but they are small, with usually 100 to 200 members.Administrators quickly deleted the announcement provided as an example. Still, \u201cas is often the case, those who needed to see it had already taken note and responded.\u201dTraditionally, this kind of business was conducted on specialized clearnet forums and deep web forums accessible through the Tor network. Still, the investigator said that much of the content moved to Telegram thanks to its policy against sharing data with authorities. This changed following the arrest of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov:\u201cAs soon as Telegram announced that it was giving out data, then the outflow to Tor started again, because it is easier to protect oneself there.\u201dStill, this is a concern to cybercriminals that may no longer be relevant. Earlier this week, Durov expressed misgivings over a growing threat to private messaging in France and other European Union countries, warning that Telegram would rather exit certain markets than implement encryption backdoors that undermine user privacy.Magazine: As Ethereum phishing gets harder, drainers move to TON and Bitcoin",

      "headline": "What are spot Solana ETFs with staking? Canada\u2019s crypto innovation explained",
      "summary": "What are spot Solana ETFs and why are they important?              A spot Solana ETF is an exchange-traded fund that holds Solana (SOL) tokens directly, providing investors real-time exposure to the asset\u2019s market price. Rather than using complex trading platforms or crypto wallets, you can access Solana via a regulated financial product traded on a traditional stock exchange.\u00a0The value of Solana ETFs is directly tied to the open market price of SOL, offering a simple way to gain exposure to the blockchain\u2019s performance without directly holding the asset. Unlike futures-based ETFs that use derivative contracts to speculate on Solana\u2019s future prices, a spot ETF tracks the performance of the actual asset.\u00a0This distinction is significant because futures products may face pricing inefficiencies, leading to performance mismatches over time. Spot ETFs are more transparent and directly reflect SOL's real-time supply and demand on the Solana blockchain.Spot Solana ETFs mark a significant step toward mainstream crypto adoption. These products enable retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to the Solana ecosystem while operating within the bounds of securities regulations.Like spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, spot Solana exchange-traded funds are expected to expand market access and serve as another entry point to decentralized finance (DeFi) for traditional investors.Did you know? Spot ETFs aim to mirror an asset\u2019s current price by directly holding the asset, while futures ETFs use derivative contracts to speculate on future price movements.                  Launch of spot Solana ETFs on the Toronto Stock Exchange              On April 16, 2025, four spot Solana ETFs started trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, following approval from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). With this, Canada became the first country to launch spot SOL ETFs with staking. The OSC granted approval to the spot Solana ETFs of four asset managers: 3iQ, Purpose, Evolve and CI Financial.\u00a0Unlike products that only track Solana\u2019s price, these funds hold SOL tokens, giving investors direct ownership of the asset. The funds are secured via institutional-grade cold storage custody. Each fund tracks a distinct Solana-related index, offering diverse strategies with onchain asset backing. Despite their structural differences, these ETFs are all designed for long-term investment, reflecting the issuers' strong belief in Solana's future in DeFi.By incorporating staking, these spot Solana ETFs provide an active way for investors to earn returns in the cryptocurrency market, all within a regulatory framework and secure, institutional-grade custody services.These ETFs enable staking through a partnership with TD Bank, allowing the SOL they hold to actively support and secure the Solana network. In return, the network issues staking rewards, which can be passed on to investors. Since Solana typically offers higher staking yields than Ethereum, this structure may translate into greater potential returns for investors.                  How does staking boost returns for  Solana ETF investors?              By offering staking, these spot Solana ETFs may boost returns for investors by an estimated 2%-3.5% annually, in addition to the performance of the underlying SOL.\u00a0The ETFs generate yield by working with staking partners that delegate up to 50% of the fund\u2019s assets for staking. Staking rewards generated by the ETF are typically shared between shareholders and the fund manager, with the specific allocation varying depending on the ETF issuer.Management fees of these spot Solana ETFs vary from 0.15% to 1%, with some providers offering fee waivers during the initial launch phase. After two days of trading, the combined assets under management for the four ETFs total about $73.5 million.Staking Solana may yield higher returns than staking Ether (ETH). The ETFs intend to pass these additional rewards on to investors, potentially reducing the long-term cost of owning the ETF.Here is a comparison between the various spot Solana ETFs with staking approved in Canada:Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest has incorporated staked Solana into its ARKW and ARKF ETFs, with both funds now holding shares of Canada\u2019s 3iQ Solana Staking ETF (SOLQ).Did you know? Altcoin ETFs track the prices of one or more cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (BTC). They diversify investor exposure within the cryptocurrency market, as various altcoins exhibit different price behaviors and underlying strengths.                  How Canada\u2019s spot Solana ETFs unlock passive income opportunities              Canada offering spot Solana ETFs with staking is an innovative step. Existing SOL investment products, such as the crypto ETFs in Europe and the futures-based ETFs in the US do not offer an opportunity to earn staking yield.Incorporating yield into a regulated crypto ETF structure addresses a long-standing demand from investors and asset managers interested in proof-of-stake (PoS) networks like Solana and Ethereum.\u00a0As staking is central to these tokens\u2019 value, its inclusion enables SOL ETFs to offer a passive income component, making them more appealing to traditional investors seeking income-generating opportunities. The OSC\u2019s approval of the staking feature for spot Solana ETFs may boost SOL\u2019s position. However, staking carries risks, such as potential losses from validator penalties (slashing) or network disruptions, which could affect returns.Nonetheless, this approval reinforces Canada\u2019s pioneering role in crypto ETF innovation, having launched the world\u2019s first spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in 2021, ahead of many other jurisdictions. By allowing staking rewards in spot Solana ETFs, Canadian regulators have signalled a growing acceptance of crypto-powered finance.\u00a0Did you know? ETFs aren\u2019t without risks. Market fluctuations can lead to losses, and tracking errors can cause an ETF'\u2019s performance to differ from its benchmark index, affecting investor outcome.                  What Canada\u2019s launch of Solana ETFs with staking means for pending SEC applications              Canada\u2019s decision provides alternative cryptocurrency investment choices for its investors and may serve as an example for other countries considering spot ETFs for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin.Despite a subdued global macroeconomic climate \u2014 partly shaped by trade tensions during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 Canada\u2019s regulators have taken a proactive stance, embracing innovation in the digital asset space. The greenlighting of Solana ETFs with staking reflects a maturing approach to crypto policy and signals confidence in alternative layer-1 networks.Meanwhile, in the United States, anticipation is building. The launch of Solana futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) on March 17, 2025, is seen as a stepping stone toward a US spot ETF. The SEC is currently reviewing 72 crypto-related ETF applications as of April 21, covering a spectrum of assets from major altcoins like XRP (XRP) to memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE), including proposals for leveraged and derivative products.As of April 21, 2025, the SEC is reviewing 72 crypto-related ETF applications, including derivatives. The filings range from major cap altcoins to memecoins and include leveraged products and options. The outcome of Canada\u2019s pioneering approach may offer valuable insights to regulators and could potentially influence the SEC\u2019s decisions regarding these filings.However, the SEC\u2019s stance may differ significantly from Canada\u2019s due to structural and regulatory complexities within the US financial system. Unlike Canada's more unified regulatory framework, the US divides oversight between multiple agencies \u2014 including the SEC, CFTC, and state regulators \u2014 creating friction in crypto policymaking.Canada\u2019s trailblazing move could nonetheless offer a valuable case study for US regulators. As markets await the SEC\u2019s decisions, the key question remains whether Washington will follow Ottawa\u2019s lead \u2014 or chart its own course and a slower timeline for non-Bitcoin spot ETFs.",

      "summary": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors have charged a man they allege created a crypto scheme that swindled 90,000 people out of $200 million in the hopes of earning returns from Bitcoin and forex trading.The SEC said on April 22 that it had charged Ramil Palafox, a dual citizen of the US and the Philippines, claiming he misappropriated over $57 million in investor funds gained through his company, PGI Global, between January 2020 and October 2021.The regulator alleged Palafox used a multilevel marketing model to execute a \u201cPonzi-like\u201d scam until the company\u2019s collapse in 2021. The SEC said he lured investors through \u201cfalse claims of crypto industry expertise and a supposed AI-powered auto-trading platform.\u201dThe SEC claimed Palafox hosted lavish events in Dubai and Las Vegas to recruit new members who were offered referral bonuses to recruit others and used investor funds to pay other investors to further promote the scheme, as well as to line his own pockets.Excerpt from the SEC\u2019s complaint against Ramil Palafox. Source: SEC\u201cPalafox attracted investors with the allure of guaranteed profits from sophisticated crypto asset and foreign exchange trading, but instead of trading, Palafox bought himself and his family cars, watches, and homes using millions of dollars of investor funds,\u201d said Scott Thompson, associate director of the SEC\u2019s Philadelphia office.\u00a0The SEC is charging Palafox with violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws and is seeking a permanent injunction to ban him from the future sale of securities and crypto assets, repayment of ill-gotten gains and civil penalties.\u00a0Justice Department files twin actionThe SEC\u2019s complaint is running parallel to action brought by the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, which arraigned Ramil Palafox on criminal charges.\u00a0According to an indictment filed under seal on March 13, federal prosecutors charged Palafox with wire fraud, money laundering and unlawful monetary transactions.Prosecutors alleged Palafox misled investors with false promises of daily returns ranging from 0.5% to 3% from Bitcoin trading and hid information about PGI\u2019s profitability, licenses, and business activity.\u00a0The indictment said Palafox told investors that substantial returns were being generated via the company\u2019s crypto exchanges and that \u201chis traders were able to make money regardless of whether the price of Bitcoin was going up or down.\u201d\u00a0However, the Justice Department alleged that, in reality, most investors' money was never used to buy or trade Bitcoin, and many lost some or all of their funds.Property listed in the indictment that would be forfeited by Palafox if convicted includes over $1 million in cash, 17 vehicles, including two Teslas, a Ferrari 458 Special, two Lamborghinis, and two Porsches, plus a variety of designer bags, wallets, shoes, jewellery and watches.Related: Crypto crime goes industrial as gangs launch coins, launder billions \u2014 UNVarious linked companies were included in the scheme, including the Praetorian Group International Trading Inc., the website for which was seized by the Department of Justice in 2021, leading to its UK-based operations being shut down by the UK\u2019s High Court.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s the agency\u2019s first crypto-related case under its crypto-friendly SEC chair, Paul Atkins, who was sworn in on April 22.The SEC had brought a case against Nova Labs in January, accusing it of selling unregistered securities by offering devices that mined the Helium (HNT) token.

      "summary": "The Federal Court of Australia has sided with fintech firm Block Earner in an appeal against a ruling that found it was required to hold a financial services license for its now-discontinued crypto-related products.\u00a0Block Earner\u2019s crypto-linked fixed-yield earning product is not a financial product, or a managed investment scheme, and is not a derivative under the Corporations Act, Justices David O\u2019Callaghan, Wendy Abraham and Catherine Button said in an April 22 judgment.\u00a0The trio said Block Earner\u2019s yield product couldn\u2019t be classed as an investment or financial product because users loaned crypto under fixed terms for interest payments and didn\u2019t pool contributions to generate further benefits. The terms and conditions framed it as a loan, and users had no exposure to the firm\u2019s business outside of the agreed interest rate, they added.A court has dismissed the legal proceedings against Block Earner and ordered Australia's financial regulator to pay costs. Source: ASICThe Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), which first brought the case, has been ordered by the court to pay costs for the proceedings, including appeals. The regulator said in an April 22 press release that it is currently \u201cconsidering this decision.\u201dBlock Earner\u2019s chief commercial officer, James Coombes, told Cointelegraph the court decision brings clarity that crypto assets shouldn\u2019t be treated differently from other asset classes when applying existing laws.\u00a0\u201cOur product was simply defined as one where customers would lend their assets to us for a fixed return, there was no share in the upside of the pool of assets and as such no Managed Investment Scheme existed,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThe fact that it included crypto assets should not alter that simple definition, and I believe this case forms a bedrock for ambitious brands around Australia to build from.\u201dAn ASIC spokesperson declined further comment.Earner product won\u2019t make a return\u00a0Despite the win in court, Block Earner will not be reviving its Earner product after axing it when legal proceedings began, but Coombes said that \u201ccrypto-backed loans products remain the core focus of the company.\u201d\u201cRegulation going forward is not an easy task, and we empathise with the regulators on this point,\u201d Coombes added. \u201cWe hope a collaborative process can bring about positive change.\u201d\u00a0Related: Australia outlines crypto regulation plan, promises action on debankingASIC launched civil legal proceedings in November 2022, arguing that Block Earner needed an Australian Financial Services License to offer its three crypto-linked fixed-yield earning products.In February 2024, an Australian court initially found the fintech firm would need a financial services license to operate its crypto yield-bearing products.\u00a0Another June 2024 ruling released Block Earner from any financial penalties because it had \u201cacted honestly\u201d and pursued its legal opinions before launching the products, which ASIC appealed.Magazine: SEC\u2019s U-turn on crypto leaves key questions unanswered",

      "headline": "Bitcoin analysts target $95K as Trump\u2019s trade war cools \u2014 Do BTC futures agree?",
      "summary": "Bitcoin (BTC) surged to a 45-day high above $91,000 on April 22, and the upward movement coincided with gold reaching a new all-time high. The price gains reflect investors' concerns over a potential economic recession amid ongoing global trade tensions.The tides are shifting, but does data support a Bitcoin price rally above $95,000?Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.chIn neutral markets, the Bitcoin futures premium typically ranges between 5% and 10% to compensate for the longer settlement period. At present, the annualized premium stands at 6%, which is not considered particularly bullish, even though BTC appreciated by $6,840 between April 20 and April 22. Some analysts interpret this as a sign that Bitcoin is beginning to decouple from the stock market.Traders\u2019 PTSD could emerge around BTC\u2019s $90K zonePart of this skepticism among traders stems from Bitcoin\u2019s repeated inability to sustain levels above $90,000 in early March. For example, Bitcoin tested the $95,000 mark on March 3, only to fall to $81,464 the following day. This inconsistent performance since the $109,346 peak on Jan. 20 has contributed to a lack of conviction among bullish investors, especially as gold has continued to set new all-time highs during the same period.S&P 500 futures (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphCurrently, Bitcoin is trading 16% below its all-time high, a figure that closely mirrors the S&P 500\u2019s decline of 14.5%. This suggests that the recent era of excessive risk-taking may be behind us. Notably, even at its lowest point below $75,000, Bitcoin\u2019s 32% drawdown was less severe than those experienced by Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (META), and Tesla (TSLA).Comments from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on April 22 contributed to easing investor concerns. As reported by Bloomberg, Bessent described the ongoing tariff standoff with China as \u201cunsustainable,\u201d suggesting an increased likelihood of de-escalation. In contrast, US President Donald Trump took to social media to assert that US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is hindering economic growth by not reducing interest rates.Bitcoin\u2019s gains contrast with investors\u2019 shift to government bondsRegardless of where the blame lies for the subdued economic growth in the United States, demand for short-term US Treasurys has risen, as evidenced by the yield on the 2-year note declining to 3.81% from 4.04% a month earlier. Essentially, investors are accepting lower returns in exchange for the perceived safety of government bonds. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin\u2019s 6.3% price increase over the past 30 days stands out as particularly notable.To determine whether these recent gains have affected professional traders\u2019 sentiment, it is important to examine the BTC options markets. If traders expect a correction, put (sell) options tend to trade at a premium, causing the 25% delta skew metric to rise above 6%. Conversely, bullish sentiment pushes the indicator below -6%.Bitcoin 30-day options skew (put-call) at Deribit. Source: Laevitas.chCurrently, the Bitcoin options market reflects limited enthusiasm following the recent surge to $91,000, with the 25% delta skew indicator at -2%, which remains within the neutral range. According to this metric, the last period of bullish sentiment occurred on Jan. 30, when Bitcoin traded near $105,000. Therefore, there is no clear evidence that large investors or market makers are anticipating a sustained rally above $95,000.Related: Institutional demand could push BTC past $200k in 2025 \u2014 AnalystsDespite some weak macroeconomic data, market participants expect a relatively strong first-quarter earnings season. FactSet reports that the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d companies are projected to achieve earnings growth of 14.8% for the first quarter compared to the prior year.While Bitcoin still has a reasonable chance of revisiting $95,000 or higher, many traders appear to be waiting for further developments in the US-China trade war before placing additional bullish bets.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
